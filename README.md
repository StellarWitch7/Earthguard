# What is Earthguard?
Earthguard seeks to add a blend of sci-fi and magic. It provides new items, blocks, and creatures, from nuclear reactors to cabbage warriors. I hope to also eventually add one or two bosses. 

# Fabric 1.19.2 Only
I will not port this mod to Forge or any older Minecraft versions. 

# Dependencies
Earthguard depends on the 1.19 version of GeckoLib Fabric available for download on [Curseforge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/geckolib). 

# Compatibility
Earthguard should be compatible with most mods as it does not modify the base game. However, I make no promises regarding compatibility with other mods. 

# Downloads
You may download Earthguard from the repository's [Releases](https://github.com/StellarWitch7/Earthguard/releases) page, from [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/earthguard), or from [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/earthguard). 

# Other Info
